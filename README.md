# Welcome to the Next.js Chatbot Adventure! 🚀

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project, brought to life using the magic of [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app). Ready to dive in? Let's get started!

## ✨ Step-by-Step Guide to Getting Started

### 1. **Install Your Dependencies** 📦

Before anything fun happens, let's get the right tools! Choose your package manager, and run one of these commands:

```bash
npm install    
# or
yarn install   
# or
pnpm install   
# or
bun install    
```

### 2. **Set Up Your Magic Keys 🗝️**

We’re not just coding we’re connecting to the world! To enable API calls, you'll need to create a `.env.local` file at the root of your project and add your shiny new API key for Gemini:

```bash
GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_google_api_key_here
GOOGLE_GENERATIVE_AI_API_KEY=your_google_api_key_here
```

You can grab your API key from the [Google API Console](https://console.developers.google.com/). It's like your key to the universe!

### 3. **Start the Development Server and Launch 🚀**

Now, we fire things up! Run this command to start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev    
# or
yarn dev      
# or
pnpm dev      
# or
bun dev       
```

### 4. **Open Your Browser** 🌐

Once the server is running, open up your browser and head over to:

[http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

Boom, you're ready to start chatting with the chatbot! 🗨️💬

### 5. **Make Your Mark: Edit Pages ✍️**

Want to add your own flair? Go to the `app/page.tsx` file and start editing. It auto-updates so you can see your changes in real-time! 🖥️✨
